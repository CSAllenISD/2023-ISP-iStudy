**iStudy Description:**
Our project is essentially a homework/study time management app. Our app would help students from elementary school to college keep track of their homework, assignments, upcoming tests/quizzes, as well as designated study times. The app will allow students to organize their assignments by due date, course, and assignment name in the in-built calendar, which can show the assignments monthly, weekly, or daily. Different courses will be color coded accordingly. Assignments can also be organized by priority or into pending and completed. The app will also notify students their assignment deadline the day before, or if they have an upcoming test in two day intervals, reminding them to study. The student can also create a personalized study plan, inputing times of when and how long they want to study for a course. The app will give reminders of when the study session ends/starts and also notifies break times and reminders to drink water, stretch, go outside for a few minutes, etc. The student can also choose from a selection of study background songs/noises in the apps catalog. The app will also provide a "homework help" feature where students are provided links to homework help websites, such as Khan Academy, based on grade level, subject, and specific topics.
